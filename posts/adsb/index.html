The system involves an aircraft with ADS-B determining its position using GPS. A suitable transmitter then broadcasts that position at rapid intervals, along with identity, altitude, velocity and other data. Dedicated ADS-B grounds stations receive the broadcasts and relay the information to air traffic control for precise tracking of the aircraft.</p><ul><li>Automatic - Requires no pilot input or external interrogation.<li>Dependant - Depends on accurate data from the aircraft’s navigation system (eg. GPS).<li>Surveillance - Provides aircraft surveillance data to facilities that require the information.<li>Broadcast - Information is continually broadcast for monitoring</ul><p>Here in Australia ADS-B is mandatory on all aircraft operating above FL300 (30,000ft).</p><p>ADS-B data is broadcast every half-second at 1090MHz using a 50kHz pulse-poition modulated digital data link, and has a very digital look when viewed on an RF waterfall:</p><p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="/posts/adsb/waterfall.png" alt="ADS-B Data on an RF Waterfall" /></p><p>Broadcasts may include:</p><ul><li>Flight Identification (flight number callsign or call sign)<li>ICAO 24-bit Aircraft Address (globally unique airframe code)<li>Position (latitude/longitude)<li>Position integrity/accuracy (GPS horizontal protection limit)<li>Barometric and Geometric Altitudes<li>Vertical Rate (rate of climb/descent)<li>Track Angle and Ground Speed (velocity)<li>Emergency indication (when emergency code selected)<li>Special position identification (when IDENT selected)<li>The ability of a ground station to receive a signal depends on altitude, distance from the site and obstructing terrain. The maximum range of each ground station can exceed 250 nautical miles. In airspace immediately surrounding each ground station, surveillance coverage extends to near the surface.</ul><h1 id="my-ads-b-receiver-setup">My ADS-B Receiver Setup</h1><p>This is the second generation of ADS-B receiver running at my station; the first generation was located on my balcony and not capable of 24x7 operation; this has since been relocated with a dedicated Orange Pi, reciever and antenna.</p><p>You can substitute anything you want for the Orange Pi, as long as it can run Linux (Armbian ideally if you want to make it as easy as my setup was) and has USB support for the USB SDR Dongle.

This will be occuring for the next week and a decision will be made as to modifications to the ADS-B configuration based on the performance of these devices. If you’re using the FlightAware Pro Stick, don’t bother with an LNA.

We do this by trimming it down to an exact ¼ wavelength required for 1090Mhz reception - or 69mm to the base or ground plane.</p><p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="/posts/adsb/antenna-1.jpg" alt="1/4 Wavelength mini-whip" /></p><p>My antenna is currently mounted outside my bedroom window and is operating without a ground plane, the next thing I plan to rectify to improve. While located along a north facing wall of a inner city apartment building; this antenna currently provides a reasonable range.</p><p>As with all radio receiving, the placement of the antenna seems to have way more impact on your reception than any particular antenna and I’ve experimented with various antennas in this setup over the last few months even the improvement by adding a simple ground plane to this antenna wasn’t worth attracting unwanted attention to it. 1090Mhz is in the gigahertz range and as we increase in frequency RF signals penetrate less material, line of site is ideal, so pick a place with a nice large sector of the sky visible if possible for the placement of your antenna.</p><h2 id="typical-air-traffic-and-range">Typical Air Traffic and Range</h2><p>A typical 48 hours of flight paths picked up by my receiver looks like:</p><p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="/posts/adsb/map.jpg" alt="A typical 48 hours" /></p><p>The current setup easily picks up most traffic within 50nm and regularly reaches closer to 100nm.

This simply connects one port to another in a pipe for you, in our case the output RAW data from dump1090 on our radio to the RAW in-port on dump1090 running on our server (below for the server-end).</p><p>This additionally allows either, or both radio1 and radio3 to take the role of ADS-B monitoring; which is useful when one is taken offline for maintenance, upgrades or changes.</p><p>Configuration of combine1090 is performed through environment variables configured in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/default/combine1090</code> file;</p><div file="/etc/default/combine1090" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="code-header"> <span text-data="/etc/default/combine1090"><i class="fa-fw far fa-file-code"></i></span> <button aria-label="copy" title-succeed="Copied!"><i class="far fa-clipboard"></i></button></div><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
