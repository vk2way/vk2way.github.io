The ultimate aim of this project is to support a wide variety of sensors on both a low-power remote microcontroller based weather station, or a more powerful full Linux system utilising a Pi. The best weather data collection, reporting and publi... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Phony Radio - My VoIP Setup</title><link href="https://vk2way.id.au/posts/allstar/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Phony Radio - My VoIP Setup" /><published>2022-01-08T00:00:00+11:00</published> <updated>2022-01-08T00:00:00+11:00</updated> <id>https://vk2way.id.au/posts/allstar/</id> <content src="https://vk2way.id.au/posts/allstar/" /> <author> <name>Jared Quinn</name> </author> <category term="Networking" /> <category term="Radio" /> <summary> Let’s get this out of the way first. The article title is tounge in cheek - I believe any means of connecting to each other, bridging internet, radio, voice, data and anything else is a good thing. Each and all to their own modes - some hams out there will argue CW is the only true mode. This project is bigger than radio; it’s focus is VoIP as a phone system that happens to be integrated wi... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Setting up DVSwitch Suite for Digital Radio</title><link href="https://vk2way.id.au/posts/dvswitch/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Setting up DVSwitch Suite for Digital Radio" /><published>2022-01-07T00:00:00+11:00</published> <updated>2022-01-07T00:00:00+11:00</updated> <id>https://vk2way.id.au/posts/dvswitch/</id> <content src="https://vk2way.id.au/posts/dvswitch/" /> <author> <name>Jared Quinn</name> </author> <category term="Networking" /> <category term="Radio" /> <summary> This is part of a series of articles on my VoIP and Telephony setup. In this article I take a deep dive into the available pre-cooked images (with a focus on those for Pi) and the tools that make up these images, what their function and purpose is. This is written as a personal investigation into what’s out there and my personal experiences from either playing with or investigating them.

In this article I take a look across the technologies, protocols, services, networks and all the bits that make up the ham VoIP ecosystem; from repeater linking to strict VoIP-only networks for hams and the pre-cooked Raspberry Pi images available to you.
