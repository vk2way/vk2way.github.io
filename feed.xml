The ultimate aim of this project is to support a wide variety of sensors on both a low-power remote microcontroller based weather station, or a more powerful full Linux system utilising a Pi.

Update: Feb 12 2022 Thanks to Rob Thomas [Linked In↗] who had been working on some GPS issues he was experiencing at the same time I was working on this project. You can find his ansible build sc... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>APRS WX Weather Station</title><link href="https://vk2way.id.au/posts/weather-station/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="APRS WX Weather Station" /><published>2021-12-04T00:00:00+11:00</published> <updated>2021-12-04T00:00:00+11:00</updated> <id>https://vk2way.id.au/posts/weather-station/</id> <content src="https://vk2way.id.au/posts/weather-station/" /> <author> <name>Jared Quinn</name> </author> <category term="Smart Home" /> <summary> Early Draft Article: Work in progress Introduction While usually I try to consolidate projects to deploy fewer devices, the decision on this project was to build it so that it would be useful for anyone wanting to build their own weather station. Originally this project was just to add some additional sensors to the balcony camera and radio system; but since it’s original inception it has ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>The Balcony Multi-System (Radio and Camera)</title><link href="https://vk2way.id.au/posts/balcony-multi-cam/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Balcony Multi-System (Radio and Camera)" /><published>2021-12-01T00:00:00+11:00</published> <updated>2021-12-01T00:00:00+11:00</updated> <id>https://vk2way.id.au/posts/balcony-multi-cam/</id> <content src="https://vk2way.id.au/posts/balcony-multi-cam/" /> <author> <name>Jared Quinn</name> </author> <category term="Radio" /> <category term="ADS-B" /> <summary> Starting from a coffee table next to my balcony and an RG58 cable running out to the antenna, this project takes that network Software Defined Radio Receiver and puts it on the balcony providing the centralised hub for an entire eco-system of balcony radio and sensors. There was never meant to be a camera on this project, though I had always wanted to put one on the balcony, this was becoming ... </summary> </entry> </feed>
