The ultimate aim of this project is to support a wide variety of sensors on both a low-power remote microcontroller based weather station, or a more powerful full Linux system utilising a Pi.

Originally this project was just to add some additional sensors to the balcony camera and radio system; but since it’s original inception it has ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>The Balcony Multi-System (Radio and Camera)</title><link href="https://vk2way.id.au/posts/balcony-multi-cam/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Balcony Multi-System (Radio and Camera)" /><published>2021-12-01T00:00:00+11:00</published> <updated>2021-12-01T00:00:00+11:00</updated> <id>https://vk2way.id.au/posts/balcony-multi-cam/</id> <content src="https://vk2way.id.au/posts/balcony-multi-cam/" /> <author> <name>Jared Quinn</name> </author> <category term="Radio" /> <category term="ADS-B" /> <summary> Starting from a coffee table next to my balcony and an RG58 cable running out to the antenna, this project takes that network Software Defined Radio Receiver and puts it on the balcony providing the centralised hub for an entire eco-system of balcony radio and sensors. There was never meant to be a camera on this project, though I had always wanted to put one on the balcony, this was becoming ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Xiaomi Aqara Button Homeassistant Blueprint</title><link href="https://vk2way.id.au/posts/xiaomi-lights/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Xiaomi Aqara Button Homeassistant Blueprint" /><published>2021-11-09T00:00:00+11:00</published> <updated>2021-11-09T00:00:00+11:00</updated> <id>https://vk2way.id.au/posts/xiaomi-lights/</id> <content src="https://vk2way.id.au/posts/xiaomi-lights/" /> <author> <name>Jared Quinn</name> </author> <category term="Smart Home" /> <summary> Actions I love these Xiami buttons and used them to replace all of the light switches in the house, each button is configured so that: Single tap - nearest light Double tap - next nearest light Long press - make any light on bright (or brighten both if both off) The blueprint supports any lighting entities/areas or devices as the two target devices; any button as the input, however ... </summary> </entry> </feed>
