Warning: This is a work in progress

PrettyFly is a first attempt at turning ADS-B data into interesting reports; it depends on 
[Tar1090](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090) from wiedehopf.  PrettyFly is currently only
able to travel back in time the duration of tar1090's flight path archive.


Project source code: [PrettyFly](https://github.com/jaredquinn/prettyfly)
