Relying on the internet for time seems a little silly to me when we have high-tech objects speeding past over-head giving us an incredibly accurate, non-connected time source, most folks call it GPS.

# Background

## But isn't GPS about location?

GPS is a system of 30+ navigation satellites circling Earth. A GPS receiver in your phone or other device listens for these signals. Using the time it takes signals to travel at the speed of light from the satellite to the receiver a location can be triangulated, often using 8 or more of the satellites available.  In order to do this GPS satellites utilise multiple onboard atomic clocks - as clocks must be accurately synchronised in order to calculate the distances accurately.

Even these small atomic clocks on GPS can drift over time and an update is sent to each of them twice a day to keep their time in sync with larger, more accurate, earth-based atomic clocks, that could not survive the journey to space.

GPS broadcasts it's signals using two frequencies known as L1 at 1575.42Mhz and L2 at 1227.6Mhz with timing signals and binary data known as alamanac and ephemeris. Spread spectrum signals are handled by using unique frequency hopping coding, uniquely idenitfying each satellite.

If you'd like to deep-dive into the nitty-gritty technical details on how the Global Positioning System network works, the Australian Institute of Measurement's Dr Bruce Warrington produced an excellent slide deck available in PDF from Engineers Australia entitled [GPS and Time: Using Clocks in Space for Accurate Time on the Ground](https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2017-01/GPS%20and%20Time%20-%20Dr_%20Warrington.pdf) ðŸ“„â†—

The term stratum means the same here as it does geologically, "a layer or a series of layers of rock in the ground.", though we're talking about layers of accuracy in a time source, a clock receiving it's time from a stratum 4 source is in itself a stratum 5 clock.  The GPS clock in our configuration here is a Stratum 0 clock providing it's time to a Stratum 1 time server.

# Hardware

## GPS Modules

Just about all GPS modules available utilise TTL-level UART (Serial) connectivity to deliver their data to a host.  If you want accurate time keeping you also want a PPS (Pulse-Per-Second) signal from the module, allowing the host to perform an interrupt on this line and keep the clock in sync every second. 

All my early tests were conducted with a cheap GPS reciever designed for drones; though it appears many on the market are based on this chipset.  

  * [Neo 6M v2 GPS Receiver and Antenna](https://amzn.to/3FMBZVX) ðŸ›’

You can get PPS from one of these modules if you're really keen, see below for more details.

If you'd prefer a pre-built waterproof enclosure that includes the PPS line, you could consider an item more like this USB-based device, which has the benefit of not requiring any GPIO connectivity or soldering.

Computer - As the Planespotting project is in production in the bedroom window with access for external small receiver antennas, the ADS-B project was selected to host the GPS clock after testing was done with the Balcony Test rig.  The ARM Core processor in this Orange Pi is more than capable of providing multiple services:

### Getting PPS from a Module without it

On the Neo modules without PPS broken out, you can do it yourself if you're keen:

## Tread Carefully

Be careful with the connectors and antenna for the Neo modules;  on day 1 of experimenting I borked mine pretty badly; it took much time and effort to split and solder the tiny connector cable bac inside the antenna, it was midly successful for the remainder of early testing until a replacement unit arrived a week later.

## Getting Wired Up

*Skip this section if you're using a USB module.*

If you're going with the Neo module; you'll need to get your TTL UART TX/RX lines and VCC/GND connected up to a suitable serial port.  On the Orange Pi I already had in production the most convenient pins for this were UART2 as they are handy to 3V3 and GND lines on the GPIO header pins.

![Orange Pi PinOut]({{page.url}}uart.jpg)

We connect the RX line from the Neo module to the TX line of the Orange Pi and the TX line to the Orange Pi's RX line.  As usual, VCC to 3V3 and GND to GND.  I soldered and heatshrank female DuPont headers to the lines to make them easy to connect and disconnect from my various Orange Pi setups.  GPIO3 makes a good candidate for the PPS interrupt line, especially if you're using DuPont headers as I find that they hold better when neighbouring pins are also occupied.  The usual advice of *if it's semi-permanent just solder it*, always applies!


![Heatshrinked Wiring]({{page.url}}wiring.png)

This is my original test wiring, before using a PPS line for more accurate time keeping.  Note the use of heatshrinking - solder of course under it, but I *love* heatshrink.

You'll need to use the `armbian-config` command to setup UART2 (which appears as /dev/ttyS2) and the gpio-pps kernel modules;  you can do this on the command line if you wish, but runnig armbian-config, selecting System and Hardware is the easiest option.  Once these kernel modules are installed, reboot and we're ready to install some software.


![Armbian Config]({{page.url}}armbianconfig.png)

The Module defaults to 9600 baud serial, 8 bits, No Parity, 1 stop bit.  There are no CTS/RTS connections required.

Of course if you opted for the USB model you can skip this wiring step and plug in the USB cable!

# The Software

## Installing the Software

At bare minimum for a production system you'll want the universal GPS daemon - `gpsd` and the related client tools found in the debian `gpsd-clients` package.  For debugging purposes you may also want miniterm found in the pyserial/python-serial package.   A modern network time server is essential if you want to share the time from your new GPS clock to the rest of your network, I recommend `ntpsec`, a secure, hardened, and improved implementation of Network Time Protocol derived from NTP Classic, Dave Millsâ€™s original.  

I'm a python dev primarilly so I added the python libraries for GPS too to have a play with in future.

Let's get the entire collection of suggested tools installed, inluding a couple of dependencies:

```
apt update 
apt install miniterm pyserial python3-serial python3-gps python-gps gpsd gpsd-clients ntpsec  
```
{: file='shell'}

## Configuring GPSd

I found just letting gpsd do it's own thing with minimal instruction tends to work best, so edit the `/etc/default/gpsd` configuration file with your preferred text editor and update it to reflect your serial port device and -n which makes gpsd start using the device immediately rather than waiting in a low-power standby mode until it's needed:

```
DEVICES="/dev/ttyS2"
GPSD_OPTIONS="-n"
```
{: file='/etc/default/gpsd'}

and tell armbian to enable and start the gps server.

```
systemctl enable gpsd
systemctl start gpsd
```
{: file='shell'}

Now, ensure your antenna is connected to the module and has a good clear view of the sky without obstructions that will interfere with signals at the 1 gigahertz range that GPS operates in; and run `gpsmon` to see what your GPS is doing!

![GPS Mon]({{page.url}}gpsmon.jpg)

If all goes well you'll see a count of the satellites connected and the current time and location (mine is redacted of course).  The output of gpsmon may differ depending on the protocol being used with your GPS receiver, but all modes will result in an accurate time, location and quality indication (number of satellites used).  If you'd like to do a deep-dive into the actual protocol used to exchange data between the module and host you can take a look at the [NMEA 183 standard](https://www.nmea.org/content/STANDARDS/NMEA_0183_Standard) â†—.


## Configuring NTP for Network Time

Having been a sysadm since the late 90s; I'm reluctant to look at the 'modern' NTP replacements like chrony, but I hear good things about them.  The original `ntpd` by Dave Mills has been around forever and has some security issues, but a team of amazing volunteers has taken on this project and produced `ntpsec`, I highly recommend this option, so that's the one detailed here.

We can ignore the `/etc/default/ntpsec` file in this case; as it's just sensible defaults; instead we'll take a look at `/etc/ntpsec/ntp.conf`, and the lines specifically for adding a shared memory or virtual network clock,  these psuedo addresses are used for different types of clocks with 127.127.1.0 reserved for your local systemclock (not something that you should use); here's some of the virtual network clocks defined by the NTP standard:

* Type 1 Undisciplined Local Clock (LOCAL)
* Type 8 Generic Reference Driver (PARSE)
* Type 17 Datum Precision Time System (GPS_DATUM)
* Type 20 Generic NMEA GPS Receiver (NMEA)
* Type 22 PPS Clock Discipline (PPS)
* Type 28 Shared Memory Driver (SHM)
* Type 30 Motorola UT Oncore GPS GPS_ONCORE)
* Type 33 Dumb Clock (DUMBCLOCK)
* Type 36 Radio WWV/H Audio Demodulator/Decoder (WWV)
* Type 46 GPSD NG client protoco

As our gps server and ntp server run on the same network we're going to use the shared memory (28) driver, so add these two lines to the configuration:

```
â€¦
server 127.127.28.0 minpoll 4 maxpoll 4 prefer
fudge 127.127.28.0 time1 0.0 refid GPS stratum 15
â€¦
```
{: file='/etc/ntpsec/ntp.conf'}

Ensure that ntpsec is enabled and start it off to test the GPS shared memory clock.

```
systemctl enable ntpsec
systemctl start ntpsec
```
{: file='shell'}

We'll cover the `fudge` line shortly, but for now the important thing to remember is to force this as a low-stratum clock (15) while we're testing as to not affect our current network time until we're ready to do so.  We give it a reference ID (GPS) and an offset, that offset we will adjust soon.

There's other settings in this file you may want to look at like including some internet time sources as well; and armbian by default will use the public ubuntu pool of time servers.

# Did it work?

Like `gpsd`, our time server has a tool which can be used to see how it's performing;  that tool is `ntpq` (network time protocol query), so we run the command `ntpq -c peers` on our sOrange Pi:

```
     remote                                   refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset   jitter

{: file='output of ntpq -c peers'}

NTP is usually very good at picking the best time sources; and reading the output above the first thing to notice is that SHM(0) (GPS) has a stratum 15 value - which is great, I don't want it being authoritive in anyway until we're sure of it's accuracy.  

The offset is a concern, but we'll keep an eye on this over a day or so to see how it goes.  You could write a quick shell script to reguarly run peers and record the value if you want a good dataset - but that's probably excessive.  

```
â€¦
fudge 127.127.28.0 time1 .1229 refid GPS stratum 15
â€¦
```
{: file='/etc/ntpsec/ntp.conf'}

Play with the time1 value on the fudge line to adjust the offset to bring it inline with a low-stratum network time source.  I found the value of .1229 worked well for me (and is close to the 116 milliseconds reported by peers initially.

Once you've got this value sorted, we can remove the fudged stratum setting and let ntp treat this like any other clock available to it:

```
â€¦
server 127.127.28.0 minpoll 4 maxpoll 4 prefer
fudge 127.127.28.0 time1 .1229 refid GPS
â€¦
```
{: file='/etc/ntpsec/ntp.conf'}


Leaving NTP running for a little while (15 minutes or so), we come back to check on it again:

```
     remote                                   refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset   jitter

We have a slight offset, and a huge jitter (which will be fixed when the PPS is finally connected) but a useable time!
