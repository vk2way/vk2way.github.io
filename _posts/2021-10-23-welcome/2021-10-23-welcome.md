Of course I need to start another project, it wouldn't be a day in the life of without!   But here we are again at the start of something new.

I am patiently waiting out the time between sitting & passing the assessment (the Certificate of Proficiency required for the Foundation Level Amature Radio icense) and the Australian Communications & Media Authority granting my license and callsign.  As you can probably tell already the callsign that has been granted is **VK2WAY** - Whiskey - Alpha - Yankee.

I decided to put this blog up, firstly because it's been years since I regularly commited to writing regularly, but more importantly because I want to collect information on all the related projects in one place.   This will include electronics, programming, radio and just about anything else that takes my fancy.
