This is the second generation of ADS-B receiver running at my station; the first generation was 
located on my balcony and not capable of 24x7 operation; this has since been relocated with
a dedicated Orange Pi, reciever and antenna.

## Current ADS-B Receiver setup:

* OrangePi One (radio1)
* [RTL Software Defined Radio](https://amzn.to/3klzocS) ðŸ›’
* Â¼Î» Mini Whip (trimmed supplied antenna)

The first task was to take the mini magnetic mount antenna and fix it.  We do this by trimming it 
down to an exact Â¼ wavelength required for 1090Mhz reception - or 69mm to the base or ground plane.

Antenna is currently mounted outside my bedroom window and is operating without a ground plane,
the next thing I plan to rectify to improve.  While located along a north facing wall of a inner
city apartment building; this antenna currently provides a reasonable range.

A typical 48 hours of flight paths looks like:

## Software Running

Making use of the current infrastructure at home including the 24x7 server controlling Home Assistant,
MQTT and the smarthome projects; the client/server model was taken for ADS-B Monitoring.
