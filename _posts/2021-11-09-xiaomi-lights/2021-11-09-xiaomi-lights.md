## Actions

I love these Xiami buttons and used them to replace all of the light switches in 
the house, each button is configured so that:

* Single tap - nearest light
* Double tap - next nearest light
* Long press - make any light on bright (or brighten both if both off)

The blueprint supports any lighting entities/areas or devices as the two target
devices; any button as the input, however it must contain the 'click_type' attribute
with a value of 'single', 'double' or 'long_click_press', in the event data, while it 
may work with other buttons it will always work best with Xiaomi Aqara buttons.
