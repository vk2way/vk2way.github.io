> I acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land where I live and operate, the Gadigal of the Eora nation and pay my/our respects to Elders past and present. I celebrate the stories, culture and traditions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elders of all communities who also work and live on this land.

[QF56oc]([https://www.karhukoti.com/maidenhead-grid-square-locator/?grid=QF56oc)â†— on *Gadigal Country* otherwise known as Sydney Australia, the most beautiful city in the world, even on a bad day:
