You can do this by clicking Continue in the portal and the option to expand your node to use NNX.Add a second node in the sequence, assuming your assigned node was 57211; your new node numbers would be 572110 and 572111.Make a note of your node password, you’ll need this soon for your ASL configuration.Installing the SoftwareMy recommended suggestion for the install is: Ubuntu 21.04 (it is possible on 22.04 with some backports) DVSwitch Debian Buster AllStarLink PackagesWARNING: ASL makes heavy use of DAHDI Telecoms kernel module, don’t try to run it in docker! If you run any kind of firewall you will need to allow port 4569 in to your host.Grab the buster installer script from http://dvswitch.org/buster; I strongly suggest you view it before running it - blindly running scripts form the internet is bad practice! You’ll find it does sensible things like adding a key to the keyring and updating your apt repositories.wget http://dvswitch.org/busterbash bashapt install allstar allstar-dahdi-linux-dkms allstar-dahdi-linux-tools allstar-asterisk-sounds allstar-asterisk-toolsOnce the install is completed you’re now ready to setup the allstar configuration. For first-time setup run the asl-menu tool and follow the wizard using the details from your ASL Portal and the first node number you have assigned. You’ll want to select a radio-less node using the dahdi/pseudo channel.Once you’ve completed the configuration there’s some manual configuration changes I highly recommend to make the configuration more manageble.You’ll find the configuration in /etc/asterisk. Most of the allstar magic happens in rpt.conf, the “repeater” application. Open this file and take the first large block of configuration that will start with your node number in square brackets (e.g. [572110]) and move the entire block into a new file /etc/asterisk/custom/rpt_572110.conf, changing the file name to reflect the node number.In essence we’re stripping out each of the nodes into their own configuration file; removing them from rpt.conf and creating new files in the custom sub-directory.Here’s my recommended configuration (/etc/asterisk/custom/rpt_572110.conf) for a bridge node that allows repeating of audio calls across multiple modes but does not carry connect/disconnect announcements and other noise that is unwelcome on DMR and other places.[572110] ; Change this to your assigned node number rxchannel = dahdi/pseudoduplex = 0linktolink = yes ; disables forcing physical half-duplex operation of main repeater whilelinkmongain = 0 ; Link Monitor Gain adjusts the audio level of monitored nodes when a signal from another node or the local receiver is received.erxgain = -3 ; Echolink receive gain adjustmentetxgain = 3 ; Echolink transmit gain adjustmenteannmode = 0scheduler = schedule ; scheduler stanzafunctions = functions ; Repeater Function stanzaphone_functions = functions ; Phone Function stanzalink_functions = functions ; Link Function stanzatelemetry=telemetrymorse = morse ; Morse stanzawait_times = wait-times ; Wait times stanzacontext = radio ; dialing context for phonecallerid = &quot;Repeater&quot; &amp;lt;572110&amp;gt; ; callerid for phone callsaccountcode = RADIO ; account code (optional)hangtime = 1000 ; squelch tail hang time (in ms) (optional, default 5 seconds, 5000 ms)althangtime = 4000 ; longer squelch tailtotime = 180000 ; transmit time-out time (in ms) (optional, default 3 minutes 180000 ms)node_lookup_metod=dnsholdofftelem = 0telemdefault = 0telemdynamic = 0phonelinkdefault = 0phonelinkdynamic = 0remotect =unlinkedct =nounkeyct = yesnotelemtx=yestelemdefault=0telemdynamic=0parrotmode = 0 ; 0 = Parrot Off (default = 0)parrottime = 1000 ; Set the amount of time in milliseconds statpost_program = /usr/bin/wget,-q,--timeout=15,--tries=1,--output-document=/dev/nullstatpost_url = http://stats.allstarlink.org/uhandler.phpYou’ll notice my ‘scheduler’, ‘functions’, ‘telemetry’ all point to common configuration blocks, the default asl-menu will have named these differently, so we’ll need to adjust those too in the master rpt.conf; so open /etc/asterisk/rpt.conf and make the following changes:Make a second copy of this file to reflect your next node number and update it accordingly.Repeat the same process for the private node that would have been created by default, renaming it to a number below 2000 (reserved in ASL for private nodes). I use 16xx and 17xx but it’s up to you what you assign - I have had issues with interconnects when 1999 is kept though so I recommend picking a number for you. We’ll keep this node as later on we’ll use it for playing scheduled transmissions by linking it to other nodes automatically.Lastly make sure your node blocks are removed from rpt.conf and replaced with lines similiar to:#includeifexists custom/nodes.conf#includeifexists custom/rpt_572110.conf#includeifexists custom/rpt_572111.conf#includeifexists custom/rpt_1701.conf#includeifexists custom/rpt_1702.confWe still need to create the custom/nodes.conf file, by default ASL will lookup nodes here, using a nodelist and with DNS. To over-ride lookup for local nodes we define them in this section, so find the [nodes] block in /etc/asterisk/rpt.conf and move it to /etc/asterisk/custom/nodes.conf; which will be included in the includes above.Create it now; mine contains:[nodes]1701 = radio@127.0.0.1:4569/1701,NONE1702 = radio@127.0.0.1:4569/1702,NONE572110 = radio@127.0.0.1:4569/572110,NONE572111 = radio@127.0.0.1:4569/572111,NONEWhile you’re in rpt.conf; find your scheduler, functions and other blocks, I recommend keeping common blocks for these; so rename them without node numbers and remove the duplicate blocks should any exist;You should end up with blocks for functions functions-remote telemetry morse wait-times memory macro controlstates_public scheduleeven if the blocks are empty (my schedule block is empty for instance in this file; but a schedule-XYZ is defined in custom/rpt_XYZ.conf and referenced if required.Lastly any public nodes must be registered to AllStar to be updated in the nodelist, DNS and be routable, you cannot accept incomming connections or make outgoing connections with an unregistered node in the [general] section of /etc/asterisk/iax.conf:register =&amp;gt; 572110:YOURPASSWORD@register.allstarlink.orgregister =&amp;gt; 572111:YOURPASSWORD@register.allstarlink.org NOTE: Be sure to update your password.

Try to get the insulation off in one section if you can, it comes in handy later!Measure the same distance for the other “leg” of the dipole (the shield side) and I place a strip of tape at that point on the insulation to make it easier to work with without constantly measuring it. Fold back the shielding; trying to retain as much of it as possible and stretch down the insulation as far towards the tape line you can.Next I take a thin strip of aluminium foil and add this ontop of the cable shielding to form a much better conductor.To keep the foil securely in place and ensure it remains so, some heatshrink is used.The coax I’m using was an offcut from a new feedline I ran on my balcony, and it’s not the most rigid of cables, so we add some mechanical support to the antenna section, mostly to keep it as straight as possible. Using a BBQ Skewer from the kitchen drawer and re-using the insulation that was stripped from the very first step of this project, I construct a reasonably solid support and temporarily hold it in place with some electrical tape.Next we secure everything with heatshrink again. In my test version of this antenna I just used tape and wrapped it tightly, but heatshrink is a much better solution for a more solid final product.Once the heatshrink is shrunk and everything is in place and solid, you should have something that looks like this:All that’s left to do is add the appropriate connector for your radio, in my case an SMA connector, you can find plenty of guides online for how to crimp connectors so I won’t cover the graphic details here - and it’s one of my least favourite things to do!Here’s a video tutorial for you if you’re not sure though: YouTube: SMA Crimp Connector Installation↗.How does it perform?… Standby for test results. Unfortunately I cannot compare it to the original antenna as the first version of this build (a very rough one) has been in production for several weeks and while it performs well, the plan is to replace that with this one in the next day.For comparison to the rough version of the antenna, it currently reaches about 40 nautical miles from my ground floor apartment in the city - not too shabby! I’ll add graphs to this post in about a week once enough data is collected to be sure it performs at least as well." }, { "title": "ESPWX Weather Modules", "url": "/posts/espwx/", "categories": "Smart Home", "tags": "weatherstation", "date": "2022-02-09 00:00:00 +1100", "snippet": "Early Draft Article: Work in progressIntroductonThis article is part of a series on building a weather station, utilising common software with a fewdifferent approaches to hardware. The ultimate aim of this project is to support a wide variety ofsensors on both a low-power remote microcontroller based weather station, or a more powerful full Linux system utilising a Pi.The best weather data collection, reporting and publishing software I’ve come across is WeeWX↗ both the Pi and ESP versions of this project cater for. While all these related weather station articlesand weather-hardware projects are designed to feed WeeWX, they can be used in any number of weather applications.Parts ListParts marked with ⚙️ came from existing items in my parts store and were chosen for that reason. ⚙️ ESP32 DevKit 🛒 ($12) ESP D32 Mini 🛒 ($12) Sensors ⚙️ Waterproof DS18B20 🛒 ($10) External Temperature ⚙️ BMP280 🛒 ($13) Temperature, Humidity and Barometric Pressure Misol Weather Station Parts ⚙️ Misol Windspeed MS-WH-SP-WS 🛒 ($40) Wind Direction (MS-WH-SP-WD) Rain Guage (WH-SP-RG) As usual Amazon affiliate links are provided, but all of this can easily be found on AliExpress too.If you’d like to buy all the entire MISOL kit not as ‘parts’, see the PiWX Weather Station↗ article,you can get the exact same software, data and weather feeds as this article presents in a much more user-friendlyready-to-report way.ESP32I also always have a pile of ESP32 or ESP8266 SoC microcontrollers on hand, while the Wemos D1 Mini (right) form factor is my preferred form factor for production projects, the standard DevKit (left) with header pins is easier for prototyping andtesting.The ESP also enables this project to be used both as data source sending ASCII data over UART to the host computer for processing, as I intend to use it, the final code produced will additionally support the ESP WiFi networking stack and MQTT client to publish data to any network.Windspeed TestingNow that the radio has been working and cabled for a while, it’s time to take a look at the next device that’s been sitting here begging for me to take a look at for way too long; it’s the anonometer. I picked it up some time ago and didn’t recall any datasheet for it, but managed to identify it as a MS-WH-SP-WD for the Misol Weather Meter, with lots of info and examples available online for it as “spare parts” are available for it from AliExpress.It simply closes a switch each rotation with each rotation representing a 2.4km/h windspeed, small and plastic:Connecting the sensor to a ESP is relatively trivial; trim off the supplied RJ11 connector and connect using GPIO12 (supply) and GPIO13 (interrupt) on the ESP32. We use a GPIO for the supply side so that later on we can programatically turn on/off the sensor, but for now we’ll just leave it turned on but utilising the final pin.For testing purposes we’ll just make sure our cabling works and we can trigger an interrupt function every time it trips it’s switch, here’s some Arduino IDE code for the test:#include &quot;Arduino.h&quot;const byte ledPin = 2;const byte interruptPin = 13;const byte powerPin = 12;volatile byte state = LOW;void setup() { delay(500); Serial.begin(115200); pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(interruptPin, INPUT_PULLDOWN); pinMode(powerPin, OUTPUT); digitalWrite(powerPin, HIGH); attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(interruptPin), blink, CHANGE);}void loop() { digitalWrite(ledPin, state);}void blink() { if(state) { Serial.print(&quot;PING\\n&quot;); } state = !state;}This isn’t yet doing any timing or math to calculate windspeed; it’s simply a test to ensure everything can work the way we want it to before we move on to the other sensors." }, { "title": "On Time - Adding a Stratum 1 Time Source", "url": "/posts/on-time/", "categories": "Radio, GPS", "tags": "software, pi, gps", "date": "2022-01-02 00:00:00 +1100", "snippet": "Relying on the internet for time seems a little silly to me when we have high-tech objects speeding past over-head giving us an incredibly accurate, non-connected time source, most folks call it GPS.Update: Feb 12 2022 Thanks to Rob Thomas [Linked In↗] who had been working on some GPS issues he was experiencing at the same time I was working on this project.

Project Cost Build Time Assumed Knowledge $10-$60 4hrs Basic LinuxFamiliarity with Single Board Computers (eg Raspberry Pi)     Minimum Electronics Knowledge (GPIO Use) BackgroundBut isn’t GPS about location?GPS is a system of 30+ navigation satellites circling Earth. A GPS receiver in your phone or other device listens for these signals. Using the time it takes signals to travel at the speed of light from the satellite to the receiver a location can be triangulated, often using 8 or more of the satellites available. In order to do this GPS satellites utilise multiple onboard atomic clocks - as clocks must be accurately synchronised in order to calculate the distances accurately.Even these small atomic clocks on GPS can drift over time and an update is sent to each of them twice a day to keep their time in sync with larger, more accurate, earth-based atomic clocks, that could not survive the journey to space.GPS broadcasts it’s signals using two frequencies known as L1 at 1575.42Mhz and L2 at 1227.6Mhz with timing signals and binary data known as alamanac and ephemeris. Spread spectrum signals are handled by using unique frequency hopping coding, uniquely idenitfying each satellite.If you’d like to deep-dive into the nitty-gritty technical details on how the Global Positioning System network works, the Australian Institute of Measurement’s Dr Bruce Warrington produced an excellent slide deck available in PDF from Engineers Australia entitled GPS and Time: Using Clocks in Space for Accurate Time on the Ground 📄↗The term stratum means the same here as it does geologically, “a layer or a series of layers of rock in the ground.”, though we’re talking about layers of accuracy in a time source, a clock receiving it’s time from a stratum 4 source is in itself a stratum 5 clock. The GPS clock in our configuration here is a Stratum 0 clock providing it’s time to a Stratum 1 time server.HardwareGPS ModulesJust about all GPS modules available utilise TTL-level UART (Serial) connectivity to deliver their data to a host. If you want accurate time keeping you also want a PPS (Pulse-Per-Second) signal from the module, allowing the host to perform an interrupt on this line and keep the clock in sync every second.All my early tests were conducted with a cheap GPS reciever designed for drones; though it appears many on the market are based on this chipset. Neo 6M v2 GPS Receiver and Antenna 🛒You can get PPS from one of these modules if you’re really keen, see below for more details.If you’d prefer a pre-built waterproof enclosure that includes the PPS line, you could consider an item more like this USB-based device, which has the benefit of not requiring any GPIO connectivity or soldering. VK-162 G-Mouse USB GPS Dongle Navigation Module External 🛒Computer - As the Planespotting project is in production in the bedroom window with access for external small receiver antennas, the ADS-B project was selected to host the GPS clock after testing was done with the Balcony Test rig. The ARM Core processor in this Orange Pi is more than capable of providing multiple services:ADS-B Reciever - Orange Pi based PlaneSpottingGetting PPS from a Module without itOn the Neo modules without PPS broken out, you can do it yourself if you’re keen:This image and more info can be found at Alan Cashin’s A Low Cost Sidereal Clock↗ page. Used with permission.Tread CarefullyBe careful with the connectors and antenna for the Neo modules; on day 1 of experimenting I borked mine pretty badly; it took much time and effort to split and solder the tiny connector cable bac inside the antenna, it was midly successful for the remainder of early testing until a replacement unit arrived a week later.Getting Wired UpSkip this section if you’re using a USB module.If you’re going with the Neo module; you’ll need to get your TTL UART TX/RX lines and VCC/GND connected up to a suitable serial port. On the Orange Pi I already had in production the most convenient pins for this were UART2 as they are handy to 3V3 and GND lines on the GPIO header pins.We connect the RX line from the Neo module to the TX line of the Orange Pi and the TX line to the Orange Pi’s RX line. As usual, VCC to 3V3 and GND to GND. I soldered and heatshrank female DuPont headers to the lines to make them easy to connect and disconnect from my various Orange Pi setups. GPIO6 (PA6 in Oranage Pi speak) makes a good candidate for the PPS interrupt line, especially if you’re using DuPont headers as I find that they hold better when neighbouring pins are also occupied. The usual advice of if it’s semi-permanent just solder it, always applies!This is my original test wiring, before using a PPS line for more accurate time keeping. Note the use of heatshrinking - solder of course under it, but I love heatshrink.The Module defaults to 9600 baud serial, 8 bits, No Parity, 1 stop bit. There are no CTS/RTS connections required.Of course if you opted for the USB model you can skip this wiring step and plug in the USB cable!The SoftwareInstalling the SoftwareAt bare minimum for a production system you’ll want the universal GPS daemon - gpsd and the related client tools found in the debian gpsd-clients package. For debugging purposes you may also want miniterm found in the pyserial/python-serial package. A modern network time server is essential if you want to share the time from your new GPS clock to the rest of your network, I recommend ntpsec, a secure, hardened, and improved implementation of Network Time Protocol derived from NTP Classic, Dave Mills’s original.I’m a python dev primarilly so I added the python libraries for GPS too to have a play with in future.Let’s get the entire collection of suggested tools installed, inluding a couple of dependencies:apt update apt install miniterm pyserial python3-serial python3-gps python-gps gpsd gpsd-clients ntpsec Boot EnvironmentYou can use the armbian-config command to setup UART2 (which appears as /dev/ttyS2) and the gpio-pps kernel modules; you can do this on the command line if you wish, but runnig armbian-config, selecting System and Hardware is the easiest option.Even if you do it this way, you should ensure the contents of your /boot/armbianEnv.txt are correct; or if you’d prefer to just edit yourself and not dealing with the whiptail menu system that armbian-config provides, here’s the bits you need:overlays=uart2 pps-gpioparam_pps_pin=PA6extraargs=nohz=offSerial Optimisationssetserial /dev/ttyS2 low_latency/usr/bin/stty -F /dev/ttyS2 -echoRebootTo be safe, I like to run a update-initramfs -u to update the boot kernel and parameters and reboot after making these changes, before moving on to making sure everything is working.Check your PPSYou can test your PPS device using, funilly enough, ppstest /dev/pps0:trying PPS source &quot;/dev/pps0&quot;found PPS source &quot;/dev/pps0&quot;ok, found 1 source(s), now start fetching data...source 0 - assert 1644669667.999939933, sequence: 389110 - clear 0.000000000, sequence: 0source 0 - assert 1644669668.999946406, sequence: 389111 - clear 0.000000000, sequence: 0source 0 - assert 1644669669.999950202, sequence: 389112 - clear 0.000000000, sequence: 0Check your GPSYou can test the GPS device using the gpscat /dev/ttyS2 command:$GNRMC,130840.00,A,3353.27213,S,15111.85287,E,0.025,,120222,,,D*78$GNVTG,,T,,M,0.025,N,0.046,K,D*3D$GNGGA,130840.00,3353.27213,S,15111.85287,E,2,11,0.77,30.2,M,19.2,M,,0000*6F$GNGSA,A,3,04,09,07,20,27,30,08,14,,,,,1.53,0.77,1.32*18$GNGSA,A,3,70,74,71,,,,,,,,,,1.53,0.77,1.32*19$GPGSV,3,1,10,04,24,040,22,05,10,227,,07,64,172,19,08,40,102,20*7B$GPGSV,3,2,10,09,61,029,36,14,38,307,25,20,18,255,26,27,20,132,26*7A$GPGSV,3,3,10,30,51,226,34,50,43,321,31*7E$GLGSV,3,1,09,70,25,004,13,71,66,310,33,72,40,222,23,73,51,171,19*61$GLGSV,3,2,09,74,44,253,20,75,02,287,,80,16,130,,82,12,134,*67$GLGSV,3,3,09,83,15,089,*52Configuring GPSdI found just letting gpsd do it’s own thing with minimal instruction tends to work best, so edit the /etc/default/gpsd configuration file with your preferred text editor and update it to reflect your serial port device and -n which makes gpsd start using the device immediately rather than waiting in a low-power standby mode until it’s needed:DEVICES=&quot;/dev/pps0 /dev/ttyS2&quot;GPSD_OPTIONS=&quot;-n&quot;The -n flag for GPSD_OPTIONS tell GPSd not to wait for any clients to connect before processing GPS packets.Additionally I specify -G to listen on all network ports as that allows any device on my network to utilise the GPS server. I additionally found issues with my particular GPS unit and the Orange Pi UART if I did not lock the baud rate to 9600 baud. My GPSD_OPTIONS value is -G -n -s 9600.GPSd also has a magic “/dev/gpsd0” device that can be used which automagically adds the PPS device and presents them as two separate devices, there are some further issues to investigate with this approach. I find the more reliable way is to ensure gpsd has both devices specified.systemctl enable gpsdsystemctl start gpsdNow, ensure your antenna is connected to the module and has a good clear view of the sky without obstructions that will interfere with signals at the 1 gigahertz range that GPS operates in; and run gpsmon to see what your GPS is doing!If all goes well you’ll see a count of the satellites connected and the current time and location (mine is redacted of course). The output of gpsmon may differ depending on the protocol being used with your GPS receiver, but all modes will result in an accurate time, location and quality indication (number of satellites used). If you’d like to do a deep-dive into the actual protocol used to exchange data between the module and host you can take a look at the NMEA 183 standard ↗.Configuring NTP for Network TimeHaving been a sysadm since the late 90s; I’m reluctant to look at the ‘modern’ NTP replacements like chrony, but I hear good things about them. The original ntpd by Dave Mills has been around forever and has some security issues, but a team of amazing volunteers has taken on this project and produced ntpsec, I highly recommend this option, so that’s the one detailed here.We can ignore the /etc/default/ntpsec file in this case; as it’s just sensible defaults; instead we’ll take a look at /etc/ntpsec/ntp.conf, and the lines specifically for adding a shared memory or virtual network clock, these psuedo addresses are used for different types of clocks with 127.127.1.0 reserved for your local systemclock (not something that you should use); here’s some of the virtual network clocks defined by the NTP standard: Type 1 Undisciplined Local Clock (LOCAL) Type 8 Generic Reference Driver (PARSE) Type 17 Datum Precision Time System (GPS_DATUM) Type 20 Generic NMEA GPS Receiver (NMEA) Type 22 PPS Clock Discipline (PPS) Type 28 Shared Memory Driver (SHM) Type 30 Motorola UT Oncore GPS GPS_ONCORE) Type 33 Dumb Clock (DUMBCLOCK) Type 36 Radio WWV/H Audio Demodulator/Decoder (WWV) Type 46 GPSD NG client protocoAs our gps server and ntp server run on the same network we’re going to use the shared memory (28) driver, so add these two lines to the configuration:…refclock pps unit 0 refid PPS minpoll 0 maxpoll 4 stratum 15 flag2 0 flag3 1 flag4 1refclock shm unit 0 refid GPS minpoll 0 maxpoll 4 stratum 15 prefer…Ensure that ntpsec is enabled and start it off to test the GPS shared memory clock.systemctl enable ntpsecsystemctl start ntpsecFor now the important thing to remember is to force this as a low-stratum clock (15) while we’re testing as to not affect our current network time until we’re ready to do so. We give it a reference ID (GPS) and an offset, that offset we will adjust soon.There’s other settings in this file you may want to look at like including some internet time sources as well; and armbian by default will use the public ubuntu pool of time servers.Did it work?Like gpsd, our time server has a tool which can be used to see how it’s performing; that tool is ntpq (network time protocol query), so we run the command ntpq -c peers on our sOrange Pi: remote refid st t when poll reach delay offset jitter======================================================================================================= PPS(0) .PPS. 15 l 6 16 377 0.0000 -114.300 0.0300 SHM(0) .GPS. 15 l 6 16 377 0.0000 -116.439 2.0221*catsl################.org 139.99.222.72 3 u 11 32 377 0.3650 -0.0437 0.1351 serenity.catslair .DNS. 16 u - 32 0 0.0000 0.0000 0.0010 time.cloudflare.com .NTS. 16 7 - 512 0 0.0000 0.0000 0.0010 au.pool.ntp.org .POOL. 16 p - 1024 0 0.0000 0.0000 0.0010-y.ns.gin.ntt.net 204.2.140.74 2 u 618 1024 1 14.0685 2.3213 0.1256+time.cloudflare.com 10.26.9.65 3 u 618 1024 1 14.0051 1.3210 0.1326+ntp3.ds.network 218.100.43.70 2 u 618 1024 1 62.0535 -0.5893 0.1282-pauseq4vntp2.datamossa.io 203.35.83.242 2 u 362 1024 1 15.3318 1.7495 0.4183-dns01.ntl02.privatecloudco.com 110.142.180.39 2 u 362 1024 1 19.8433 -0.8128 0.2023+ntp2.ds.network 162.159.200.123 4 u 362 1024 1 62.9446 -0.4334 0.2466NTP is usually very good at picking the best time sources; and reading the output above the first thing to notice is that SHM(0) (GPS) has a stratum 15 value - which is great, I don’t want it being authoritive in anyway until we’re sure of it’s accuracy.The offset is a concern, but we’ll keep an eye on this over a day or so to see how it goes.Graphs and Fudge!If you’d like great data and graphing of NTP you can install ntpsec-ntpviz, for an example of the output from these tools take a look at Last 24 hours updated hourly Last Week updated every 12 hoursotherwise you can regularly monitor it with human eyeballs and the ntpq command, and adding the -u option to ntpq will print the SI units similiar to the way du does with it’s -h option for human readable.If you need to fudge your clock a little you can using the time1 paramter.refclock shm unit 0 refid GPS minpoll 0 maxpoll 4 time1 0.1315 stratum 3 preferPlay with the time1 value on the fudge line to adjust the offset to bring it inline with a low-stratum network time source.

The AU $20 spent got me the aluminium enclosure with heavy duty cover, waterproof front lens and rear panel with waterproof cable connectors, an additional hole will be requied for the PoE connector soon.The First RadioI’ve been using an RTL radio on this Pi for some time now, infact it was the running the first ADS-B monitoring centre here at VK2WAY before the project that made it operational 24x7. Both SoapySDR and rtl_tcp are used here for providing network access to the RTL SDR when needed. This radio is currently a Nooelec RTL SDR, Low Noise Amplifier and DC Block, powered via USB because I didn’t think ahead and get the SDR with bias-T power to the antenna.When the LNA, DC Block and SDR are combined back-to-back and connected to the USB connector of the Orange Pi, it becomes quite long and obviously not going to fit inside of the enclosure.This isn’t a bad thing, because of heat and RF noise we’re going to keep the RTL SDR, LNA and other radio equipment outside of this main enclosure and run USB to it. This again keeps the project modular too, allowing the SDR and antennas to be disconnected from this compute device and used with any other laptop or device needed.Getting the PowerTo reduce the overhead of what is required in the device itself, I decided to use an existing 5V 3A power supply and a “power over ethernet converter” that accepts any DC input and delivers it on the output, rather than a conventional standard PoE Supply. This may be revised in the future depending on the cable length that ends up being between the injector and extractor, but for now testing has started using this method.The converters can be picked up very cheaply on AliExpress at 12V Power Over Ethernet Passive POE including waterproofing and mounting hardware.On the splitter end of the adapter I removed the DC jack and replaced it with two duPont female header pins to directly utilise the 5V and GND pins provided on the Pi for external power. Neatly heatshrink the individual connectors, be sure sure to add a litter larger heatshrink first to bring over to top for a profesional finish!More testing is required on exactly how long and what cable will be needed to ensure adequate power gets along whatever the final run for this device is, so keep in mind that it will unlikely remain at this 5V, though we’re going to try!I did a quick test of the cable with a multimeter and everything looked fine, now to trust the documentation that the 5V and GND pins ARE the ones that they say they are on the Orange Pi, connect them up and test it out.

Folks like me (and maybe you too!). This article describes what ADS-B is, how I receive it and how I display it, report on it and ultimately send it on to other folks. Project Cost Build Time Assumed Knowledge $60-$120 2hrs-1day Basic LinuxFamiliarity with Single Board Computers (eg Raspberry Pi) What is ADS-B?ADS-B is a system in which electronic equipment onboard an aircraft automatically broadcasts the precise location of the aircraft via a digital data link. The system involves an aircraft with ADS-B determining its position using GPS. A suitable transmitter then broadcasts that position at rapid intervals, along with identity, altitude, velocity and other data. Dedicated ADS-B grounds stations receive the broadcasts and relay the information to air traffic control for precise tracking of the aircraft. Automatic - Requires no pilot input or external interrogation. Dependant - Depends on accurate data from the aircraft’s navigation system (eg. GPS). Surveillance - Provides aircraft surveillance data to facilities that require the information. Broadcast - Information is continually broadcast for monitoringHere in Australia ADS-B is mandatory on all aircraft operating above FL300 (30,000ft).ADS-B data is broadcast every half-second at 1090MHz using a 50kHz pulse-poition modulated digital data link, and has a very digital look when viewed on an RF waterfall:Broadcasts may include: Flight Identification (flight number callsign or call sign) ICAO 24-bit Aircraft Address (globally unique airframe code) Position (latitude/longitude) Position integrity/accuracy (GPS horizontal protection limit) Barometric and Geometric Altitudes Vertical Rate (rate of climb/descent) Track Angle and Ground Speed (velocity) Emergency indication (when emergency code selected) Special position identification (when IDENT selected) The ability of a ground station to receive a signal depends on altitude, distance from the site and obstructing terrain. The maximum range of each ground station can exceed 250 nautical miles. In airspace immediately surrounding each ground station, surveillance coverage extends to near the surface.My ADS-B Receiver SetupThis is the second generation of ADS-B receiver running at my station; the first generation was located on my balcony and not capable of 24x7 operation; this has since been relocated witha dedicated Orange Pi, reciever and antenna.You can substitute anything you want for the Orange Pi, as long as it can run Linux (Armbian ideally if you want to make it as easy as my setup was) and has USB support for the USB SDR Dongle. I am a huge fan of the Orange Pi PC (1GB) model as you can pick it up from the official store for around $40AUD. Orange Pi One 🛒 or the Official Shenzen Xunlong Store↗ on AliExpress. Nooelec NESDR SMArt v4 Software Defined Radio 🛒 ¼λ Mini Whip (trimmed supplied antenna) Be aware also many RTL-SDRs are NOT well engineered and have large drifts or are only designed to pick up strong broadcast FM/DVB-T signals, read reviews and buy from a reputable source. I highly recommend this one.If you can get it though get this, I’ve been wanting a second one but they haven’t been available for sometime. FlightAware Pro Stick USB Receiver 🛒Optional Extras 17th Nov 2021 Edit: While building the double Moxon array antenna for 70cm satellite work the LNA and DC-Filter destined for that project are being tested on my ADS-B project. This will be occuring for the next week and a decision will be made as to modifications to the ADS-B configuration based on the performance of these devices. If you’re using the FlightAware Pro Stick, don’t bother with an LNA. There’s an integrated 20dB 1090Mhz optimised amplifier that your LNA will not improve. Noelec LNA 🛒 Noelec DC-Block 🛒Getting StartedThe first task was to take the mini magnetic mount antenna and fix it. We do this by trimming it down to an exact ¼ wavelength required for 1090Mhz reception - or 69mm to the base or ground plane.My antenna is currently mounted outside my bedroom window and is operating without a ground plane,the next thing I plan to rectify to improve. While located along a north facing wall of a innercity apartment building; this antenna currently provides a reasonable range.As with all radio receiving, the placement of the antenna seems to have way more impact on your reception than any particular antenna and I’ve experimented with various antennas in this setup overthe last few months even the improvement by adding a simple ground plane to this antenna wasn’t worthattracting unwanted attention to it. 1090Mhz is in the gigahertz range and as we increase in frequencyRF signals penetrate less material, line of site is ideal, so pick a place with a nice large sector of the sky visible if possible for the placement of your antenna.Typical Air Traffic and RangeA typical 48 hours of flight paths picked up by my receiver looks like:The current setup easily picks up most traffic within 50nm and regularly reaches closer to 100nm. This was greatly improved with a ground plane on the antenna as was used during the first generationof this project however a more concealed antenna was required for 24x7 operation.The Nuts and BoltsMaking use of the current infrastructure at home including the 24x7 server controlling Home Assistant,MQTT and the smarthome projects; the client/server model was taken for ADS-B Monitoring.The radio and main server are seperated in my environment purely for convenience; this also allows tar1090to manage a much larger dataset and more storing and development opportunities around the ads-b data; thisdetails how that’s done.The Radio Radio1 - Orange Pi with USB RTL-SDR Dongle Armbian 21.08.3 Focal (Linux 5.10.60-sunxi)↗ Dump1090-mutability↗ Combine1090↗ Note: A FlightAware Pro Stick is pictured above. While I’ve had excellent results with this product, it is regularly unavailable.

Configurtion is very straight forward, use yourfavourite text editor to update the /etc/default/dump1090-mutability file.You’ll definitely want to update your LON and LAT to as close as you can find for the location of your antenna. I do this to 6 decimal places. DEVICE is useful if you’re running more than one radio on your computer. I have no problems decoding ADS-B with GAIN set to “max” and if you’ve got a good dongle PPM can beleft at 0 (though with some cheap dongles I’ve seen this need to go as high as 160!).Dump1090 has it’s own web interface to show you what’s in the air right now around you; you can reach thisat http://IP-ADDRESS/dump1090 if you have lighttpd running and have installed dump1090 from the Armbian packages. Note: Sydney Airport has a noise curfew overnight and we see little traffic in this area until 6am. This screen shot was taken at 0100 hours, local time.If you’re not running a split client/server model, you should leave this combine1090 step out, it’s only useful for pushing data between dump1090 instances. You can run tar1090, PrettyFly and the data feeders mentioned in the Server section on the same device runningyour radio.Combine1090Combine1090 is used to forward the ADS-B traffic between the dump1090 protocol using the defined networkports; usually this is setup on the server side to connect to the remote radio but it made much more sense in thisconfiguration for the radio to run in push mode. Under the hood Combine1090 is just a shell script and systemd startupwrapper around the swiss-army knife utility familiar to every network and system administrator, nc (netcat). This simplyconnects one port to another in a pipe for you, in our case the output RAW data from dump1090 on our radio to the RAW in-port on dump1090 running on our server (below for the server-end).This additionally allows either, or both radio1 and radio3 to take the role of ADS-B monitoring; which isuseful when one is taken offline for maintenance, upgrades or changes.Configuration of combine1090 is performed through environment variables configured in the /etc/default/combine1090 file;SOURCES=127.0.0.1PORTS=30005TARGET=houseserver.lan:30004Restart tar1090 using systemctl restart combine1090You should leave the dump1090 options (RECIEVER/DECODER and last few lines of the default config) commented out and utilise the packaged dump1090-mutability (or dump1090-fa from piaware) for Armbian.I highly recommend you add the rtl-sdr package as well for other handy tools (like rtl_tcp to remote control the radio across the network, but more on this in a future post)! Combine1090 will keep trying to connect until your server is online, so move on to the next section already.The ServerThe server already existed on my network; if you’re running without it you can leave combine1090 off for now. It’s worth considering the split as tar1090’s data storage is not well optimised for large amounts of data, and I now keep 48 hours offight history in the tar1090 data file.

Note: The ‘range’ screenshot earlier in this article shows tar1090 with the ‘pTracks’ URL query-string argument.Installation is very easy, following the instructions from the tar1090 project; once installed you can modify the /etc/default/tar1090 file and modify the relevant variables.The important one to update:# hours of tracks that /?pTracks will showPTRACKS=48Restart tar1090 using systemctl restart tar1090Related Projects PrettyFly - Prettified ADS-B reporting, work in progress.The PrettyFly project is a work in progress which I will soon be developing further.

For now though check out thepage above for some of the reporting that is done by this first foray into writing code to report on ADS-B data.Some exampel output from PrettyFly:By Country of Registration 1. 🇦🇺 Australia (124) 2. 🇺🇸 United States (11) 2. 🇨🇳 China (11) 3. 🇸🇬 Singapore (8) 4. 🇳🇿 New Zealand (4) 5. 🇦🇪 United Arab Emirates (3) 5. 🇲🇾 Malaysia (3) 6. 🇹🇼 Taiwan (2) 6. 🇯🇵 Japan (2) 7. 🇹🇭 Thailand (1) 7. 🇱🇰 Sri Lanka (1) 7. 🇰🇷 South Korea (1) 7. 🇷🇺 Russia (1) 7. 🇶🇦 Qatar (1) 7. 🇵🇭 Philippines (1) 7. 🇬🇷 Greece (1) 7. 🇫🇯 Fiji (1)Along with more detailed categorisation and reporting:Flights of Interest🚑 Medical 9: VH-RFD/AM228, VH-RFD/AM293, VH-RFD/AM277, VH-AMQ/AM242, VH-PWX/AE913, VH-ZSU/CFH23, VH-AMR/AM214, VH-NAJ/AM227, VH-ZCY/CFH21⛑ Rescue 1: VH-TJE/RSCU201✈️ RAAF 4: A36-002/ASY326, A97-465/TROJ26, A30-003/WGTL15, A56-003/EVY55💣 Military Contractor 4: VH-SLF/FRSC11, VH-SLF/FRSC31, VH-LJU/FRSC12, VH-LRH/FRSC32It was named PrettyFly mostly because of it’s unapologetic use of emoji.You can find the PrettyFly project at https://github.com/jaredquinn/prettyfly↗, including the(almost) daily updated data/*.json files for operators and aircraft classification.Live DataI additionally send my data to my own Tar1090 instance running in the cloud and in future posts will be exploring additional tools,bringing in data for more stations and a range of other related articles.I host the live tools on Vultr, you can sign up using my referral link↗.Data FeedersIf you’re going to run this kind of receiver, it’s worth feeding the data to FlightAware at minimum as the benefits they provide (buiness plan access) is worth it alone; however as a believer in open-data and sharing, I particularly like ADSBHubas they will provide the global ‘firehose’ of ADS-B data from all 2,000 contributors in their community.I feed data to: VK2WAY Live ADS-B Hub Station VK2WAY/SYD1↗ FightAware - FlyByNightSydney↗ OpenSky Network↗ FlightRadar 24 (Radar T-YMCO1)Running the split client/server mode also gives me the benefit of running all my data feeders in the centralised location, not requiringa setup on each of the radio receiver devices or future versions of it, making configuration management much easier." }, { "title": "Introducing The Dirge (A CAN Bus)", "url": "/posts/the-bus/", "categories": "Electronics, The Dirge CAN Bus Module", "tags": "can, esp, iot", "date": "2021-10-24 00:00:00 +1100", "snippet": "Dirge’s BusIntro…The “Dirge” SensorThe Sensor Project on GitHubFeatures TPS54202 Based 12V to 5V Converter Dual AO4407A 30V 12A Switching channels (12V SW1 &amp;amp; SW2) 12V Input Voltage Monitoring AHT20 Temperature/Humidity Sensor Jumper selectable Supply MCU 5V from USB, 5V BUS or 12V Supply Enable/Disable 12V to 5V buck jumper MCP2562 / MCP2515 5V CAN (Controller Area Network) Bus Driver 4 Normally Open Button Inputs (supports momentary &amp;amp; toggles) 2 TTL (3V3) Output Signals (not for power supply) TXB0104PWR IC 4bit Bi-directional Level Shifter UART TX / RX LED Pixel Pusher 5V Data CH1/CH2 6 DIP Switches 1-4=Config/Multiplexed with BTN INs 5=Enable 5V Level Shifter PXL/UARTs 6=Terminate CAN bus with 120Ohm " }, { "title": "Welcome to vk2way.id.au", "url": "/posts/welcome/", "categories": "General", "tags": "website", "date": "2021-10-23 00:00:00 +1100", "snippet": "Of course I need to start another project, it wouldn’t be a day in the life of without!

As you can probably tell already the callsign that has been granted is VK2WAY - Whiskey - Alpha - Yankee.I decided to put this blog up, firstly because it’s been years since I regularly commited to writing regularly, but more importantly because I want to collect information on all the related projects in one place. This will include electronics, programming, radio and just about anything else that takes my fancy." } ]
