We do this by trimming it down to an exact ¬º wavelength required for 1090Mhz reception - or 69mm to the base or ground plane.Note: A FlightAware Pro Stick is pictured below.  This product is regularly unavailable however Ihighly recommend the Nooelec NESDR SMArt v4 SDR.  Many RTL-SDRs are NOT well engineered and have largedrifts or are only designed to pick up strong broadcast FM/DVB-T signals, read reviews and buy from areputable source.Antenna is currently mounted outside my bedroom window and is operating without a ground plane,the next thing I plan to rectify to improve.  While located along a north facing wall of a innercity apartment building; this antenna currently provides a reasonable range.A typical 48 hours of flight paths looks like:Software RunningMaking use of the current infrastructure at home including the 24x7 server controlling Home Assistant,MQTT and the smarthome projects; the client/server model was taken for ADS-B Monitoring.

    "snippet": "Of course I need to start another project, it wouldn‚Äôt be a day in the life of without!   But here we are again at the start of something new.I am patiently waiting out the time between sitting &amp;amp; passing the assessment (the Certificate of Proficiency required for the Foundation Level Amature Radio icense) and the Australian Communications &amp;amp; Media Authority granting my license and callsign.  As you can probably tell already the callsign that has been granted is VK2WAY - Whiskey - Alpha - Yankee.I decided to put this blog up, firstly because it‚Äôs been years since I regularly commited to writing regularly, but more importantly because I want to collect information on all the related projects in one place.   This will include electronics, programming, radio and just about anything else that takes my fancy."
